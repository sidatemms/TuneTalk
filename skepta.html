            <h4>Ignorance Is Bliss Review:</h4>
            <p>
              Ignorance Is Bliss is the fifth studio album by British
              rapper Skepta. It was released on 31 May 2019 through Boy
              Better Know, and is the follow-up to his 2016 album
              Konnichiwa. The album features appearances from Nafe
              Smallz, Key!, J Hus, Cheb Rabi, B Live, Lancey Foux,
              Lay-Z, Wizkid and Boy Better Know.

            <h4>Album Information:</h4>
            <p>
              Skepta's "Ignorance Is Bliss" just dropped, and it's got me
              vibing. After the epic comeback with "Konnichiwa" in 2016,
              my expectations were high, and Skepta doesn't disappoint.
              While it may not hit as hard, his flow is still on point,
              dancing effortlessly through the beats. Tracks like "Bullet
              from a Gun" dive into real-life struggles, showing a more
              personal side. The production is a cool mix of grime nostalgia,
              UK garage, and a touch of trap. While it's not exactly
              'Konnichiwa 2.0,' "Ignorance Is Bliss" solidifies Skepta's
              rep as a genre-blending legend.
